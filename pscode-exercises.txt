// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for 1 number between 1 and 1000
If last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 then print "even"
If last digit is 1, 3, 5, 7, 0r 9 then print "odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

ask for 5 numbers between 1 and 1000 
add the 5 numbers together 
divide by 5
print this number with the message "average" 
find number closest to 0 
print this number with the message "minimum"
Find the number farthest from 0 
print this number with the message"maximum"
